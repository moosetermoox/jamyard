# Next Steps

Living roadmap. When a session starts with "what should we work on?", start here.
History lives in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); parked ideas in [DEFERRED-IDEAS.md](DEFERRED-IDEAS.md).

## Now (highest value, ready to start)

1. **Field-test in a real classroom.** Everything below is guesswork until students
   touch it. Most games are sim-tested but not human-tested. The teacher console,
   Connection Pack, Simple view, and juice pack all shipped recently and have never
   met a real class. Capture what confuses kids, what stalls, what the teacher
   reaches for and can't find. `scripts/demo-room.js` makes phone-in-hand testing
   easy meanwhile.

## Next

2. **Remaining safety items** (from SAFETY-DESIGN.md): anonymous mode option,
   rate limiting / DoS limits (non-AI socket events; AI endpoints now guarded),
   PII redaction.
3. **Editor odds and ends:**
   - class-critique ships with an empty reveal template (flagged during game sweep)
4. **New phase ideas** (from the 2026-06-10 ideation; buzz + estimate + branching
   votes shipped):
   - **`match`** — pair two lists (vocab↔definitions, quotes↔authors), auto-scored,
     drag-to-connect (rank's drag infra reuses).
   - **`sort`** — drag items into named buckets (categorization: metaphor vs simile),
     class-consensus reveal. Different cognition from rank's ordering.
   - **`secret-role`** — hidden per-player info (Spyfall/Chameleon pattern); per-player
     delivery exists ({{X.mine}}), new part is role assignment + projector discipline.
     The most-requested-by-students unbuilt thing once they see bluffing games.
   - **`appreciation`** — everyone writes something kind about an assigned classmate
     (rotation guarantees coverage), teacher previews every note before private
     delivery. Connection-family round 2; needs the new privacy pattern.

## Later (needs accounts or more users first)

4. **Accounts / owner model.** Game configs already persist in Neon Postgres;
   accounts unlock per-teacher libraries, recipe sharing/marketplace, content
   moderation surface. The `recipes/user/` gitignore boundary already marks the
   user-content line.
5. **Connection Pack voice modes** — v1.5 recorded clips, v2 WebRTC (staged in
   connection-pack-spec.md; deliberately NOT built yet).
6. **game-loader as a compiler** (architecture review item — see DEFERRED-IDEAS.md).
   Biggest long-term win for AI-generated config reliability; ~a week of work.
